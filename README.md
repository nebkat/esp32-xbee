# ESP32 XBee
ESP32 XBee is the official firmware for the Ardusimple [WiFi NTRIP Master](https://www.ardusimple.com/product/wifi-ntrip-master/) ESP32 XBee device [[3D model]](https://github.com/nebkat/esp32-xbee/blob/master/esp32-xbee-board.step), made with [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). Its main function is to forward the UART of the ESP32 to a variety of protocols over WiFi.

Although it is primarly intended for the WiFi NTRIP Master, this software can run on any ESP32 with minimal modifications to the GPIO configuration by, for example, connecting the XBee 3V3, RX0 and GND to the equivalent pins on the ESP32 (TX connection not needed).
